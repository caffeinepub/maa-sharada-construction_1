  "summary": "The diff implements a new Project Gallery section with 6 responsive images, relative asset paths, modal preview behavior, and updates header/footer navigation to scroll to the gallery. Two additional changes appear unrelated to the gallery request (UTM tracking code in Footer and an empty React Query hooks placeholder).",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added UTM tracking/app identifier logic in the footer (hostname-based encodeURIComponent)",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asked to add a Project Gallery section and update navigation; tracking/UTM functionality was not requested and is not required for gallery placement or links.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/site/Footer.tsx (\"Generate app identifier for UTM tracking\")",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (Footer description mentions \"UTM tracking\")"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Added an empty placeholder React Query hooks file (useQueries.ts)",
      "reason": "No requirement mentions React Query or adding placeholder hook files; the gallery is explicitly static and requires no backend/data hooks.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (\"frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts\": \"Empty placeholder file for React Query hooks\")"
